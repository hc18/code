####1. 虚拟语气本质理解
>虚拟的变化体现在动词上，动词的变化体现时态的变化，或者情态动词的帮助上。
####2. 形式变化
######A. 条件从句的虚拟变化
- 主从句互相作为判断时间的参考
1. 对过去事件的虚拟
>公式：
从句：If 主语 had done/ had been (宾语/表语),
主句：主语 would/should/could/might have done/ been (宾语/表语)。

>If it **had rained**,I **have not gone** to deliver my lectures.
>If he had worked harder, he _________ the exams. **(would have got through)**
>______ you were busy, I wouldn’t have bothered you with my questions. **(If I had realized)**
2. 对现在事件的虚拟
>公式：
从句：If 主语 did/ were (宾语/表语),
主句：主语 would/should/could/might do/ be (宾语/表语)。

>If there were no subjunctive mood, English _____ much easier to learn.(**would be**)
>If the power were **cut**, the lecture **would/ could/ should/ might** be suspended.
3. 对将来事件的虚拟
>公式：
从句：If 主语 should do(be)/ were to do (宾语/表语),
主句：主语 would/ should/ could/ might do/ be (宾语/表语)。

>If the flight ticket to England **were to be** available, I **would/ should go** for a sudden trip.
>If they **were to arrive** before we depart the day after tomorrow, we **should have** a wonderful dinner party.
>If they **should come** to us, I **should ask** them some questions.

######B. 条件从句的变态虚拟
1. 主从句时间分别独立，各自虚拟，互不干扰（一般有时间提示）
>If I _________ harder at school, I **would be sitting** in a comfortable office ***now***. **(had worked)**
>If I **hadn’t stood** under the ladder to catch you when you fell, you _________ **now**. **( wouldn’t be smiling)**
>If you had studied the problem carefully yesterday, _________.(you would not find any difficulty **now**)
>If only the patient ______ a different treatment instead of using the antibiotics, he might still be alive **now**.(had received)
2. 从句省略if，部分倒装
>对过去事件的虚拟
从句：If 主语 had done/ had been (宾语/表语)，
变换成
Had 主语 done 宾语，
Had 主语 been 表语，

>对现在事件的虚拟
从句：If 主语 did/ were (宾语/表语),
变换成
Did 主语 do 宾语，
Were 主语 表语，

>对将来事件的虚拟
从句：If 主语 should do(be)/ were to do (宾语/表语),
变换成
Should 主语 do/be 宾语/表语，
Were 主语 to do 宾语，

>**Had Judy been** more careful on the maths exam, she ____ much better results now. (would get)

> _________ right now, she would get there on Sunday.
A. Would she leave (would 不能用在从句)
B. If she leaves （不是虚拟语气）
**C. Were she to leave （将来，虚拟语气倒装，正解）**
D. If she had left （过去，虚拟语气，和now 不符）

>The business is risky. But _________, we would be rich.
**A. should we succeed (从句虚拟语气只能用 should)**
B. might we succeed
C. would we succeed
D. could we succeed
3. 对过去事件虚拟的几种情况

|should/ ought to + have done |责备+相反|本应该。。。却没有|
|---|---|---|
|would + have done|无感+相反|应该。。。却没有|
|could + have done|理性+正话|以你的能力有可能。。。|
|might/ may/ might not + have done|（肯/否）推测+50%（可能）|might = might not|
|must + have done|（肯）推测+90%|肯定。。。|
|can’t + have done|（否）推测+90%|绝不可能。。。|
|need + have done|需要+相反|本需要。。。却没做|
|needn’t + have done|不需要+相反|本不需要。。。却做了|

D. would be
主句，I would have told him the answer，从句 had it been possible，后面是真实的情况，不需要虚拟，用was
