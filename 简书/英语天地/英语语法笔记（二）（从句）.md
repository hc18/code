>3. 状语从句
####1. 名词性从句
######1.1 主干成分
- 主语(n.)＋谓语(v.)＋宾语(n.)
- 主语从句(wh-/that)＋谓语(v.)
- 谓语(v.)＋宾语从句(wh-/that)
>从句分辨：
整个从句（wh-/ that）充当句子成分；
充当**什么成分**叫做**什么从句**。

>**What** has happened is the fact of murder. (主语从句)
**Where** he stands is dangerous.(主语从句)
**That** these seas are being over-fished is an obvious fact.(主语从句)
I recall **how** annoying smoking everywhere was years ago.(宾语从句)
**What** has happened was **that** people cannot confess fully to their dreams.(主语从句+宾语从句)
- 做题步骤
  - 找动词，判断从句类别
  - 解析从句，判断从句缺不缺东西，以及需要哪个连词
>Quality is ______counts most.
A. which
B. that
**C. what**
D. where
is 是谓语动词，说明是宾语从句，缺主语，选what. 
>that 在名词性从句里面补充当任何成分，只起连词作用。which 强调的是哪一个。

>The government has promised to do ___ lies in its power to ease the hardships of the victims in the flood-stricken area.
A. however (无论怎样，然而)
B. whichever（无论哪个）
**C. whatever（无论如何）**
D. wherever（无论哪里）
ever = 无论

####2. 定语从句
######2.1 修饰成分
- 前置定语＋n.＋后置定语（定语从句wh-/that）
  - 后置定语只能是从句

|---|---|---|
|which|物n. |强调哪一个|
|who|人n. |几乎万能|
|whom|人n. |在句子中充当宾语的成分|
|whose + n|人n. |谁的+必须接名词|
|where|地点n.|在。。。地方|
|why|原因n.|只和reason搭配|
|that|人或物n.||
