**Currently, a discussion is taking place in Chinese education system, that is,** whether becoming a graduate student can change one's life. **Some educational researchers hold the opinion that** graduate life is likely to change one's life. **Personally, I think that this remark is justified, as can be seen in the following paragraphs.**
**Clearly**, students **can benefit the most if** they Obtain a doctorate degree. Here, I'd like to support my view with serval examples. **For one thing**, the top three desired skills for every industry position are critical thinking, complex problem solving, and correct decision-making. After spending uncountable hours, days, weeks, months and years to find answers to the world's toughest unknown questions, phDs excel in all three of these areas. **For another thing**, they are comfortable with uncertainty. Most of phDs, have no idea  whether their paper is going to get passed and publihed, have no idea  when their committee is going to give them the green light to defend their thesis, and even have no idea if the project they're working on has an answer at all.**As a result**, they forged a resolute character, which would contribute directly to their future career. 
**some readers might argue that** Bill Gates does not finish the university but becomes one of the best-known entrepreneurs of the personal computer revolution. **So it is also an option to** say that there is no relationship between academicÂ diplomas and one's life. **This statement does contain an element of truth, but neglects the other side of this issue:** the people who as clever as bill gates are few and Not every entrepreneur will succeed. 
**To sum up, despite** there are some very smart people in this world who do not need school education, Most people change their life because of a high training PhD career. **This conclusion might be traditional, but it turns out to be realistic and rational in the current social setting.**

a university can change your life only if you are willing to change your life
