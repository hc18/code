>2. 非谓语动词  doing/done/to do
>3. 倒装
####1. 谓语动词
- 解题思路：
  1. 看单选空格是否缺谓语
  2. 看选项是否结构完整(足以组成一个谓语)
  3.  看前后半句找时态一致的谓语动词
  4. 看语态，是主动还是被动
######1.1 时态变化
>1. 结构完整才是谓语动词一般态
>2. 英文时态不可跨越
- 一般态——do: did, do/does, will do
- 进行态——be doing: was/ were doing, am/is/are doing, will be doing
- 完成态——have done: had done, have/has done, will have done

|进行态|过去进行时态|过去+过去/现在|was/ were doing|
|---|---|---|---|
||现在进行时态|现在+现在/将来|am/is/are doing|
||将来进行时态|将来|will be doing|
|完成态|过去完成时态|过过+过去|had done|
||现在完成时态|过去+现在| have/has done|
||将来完成时态|现在/将来+将来| will have done|
|完成进行态|过去完成进行时态|过过+过去+现在|had been doing|
||现在完成进行时态|过去+现在+将来|have been doing|
||未来完成进行时态(少)|现在/将来+将来|will have been doing|

######1.2 语态变化
- 主动语态：主语 do 宾语 have
- 被动语态（主宾倒装）：宾语 be done by 主语
>The Minister of Finance is believed ________ of imposing new taxes to raise extra revenue.
A. that he is thinking
***B. to be thinking***
C. that he is to think
D. to think
选B, 被动不接宾语，排除AC；D是主动，也排除
####2. 非谓语动词
- 解题思路：
  1. 看句子是否缺谓语，不缺才要填非谓语动词
  2. 看选项是否结构完整(足以组成一个谓语)
  3. 找到这个词修饰的主语
  4. 看语态，是主动还是被动
######2.1 动名词 doing
######2.2  分词 doing & done
- 作定语：doing/done+名词 ；名词+doing/done 短语
- 作状语：Doing/Done…，主谓宾
- **独立主格：名词+doing/done…**，主谓宾
>Seen in this light, economic crisis is not as serious as people generally suppose.
>(If) Seen in this light, economic crisis is not as serious as people generally suppose.
>(If)( economic crisis is) seen in this light, economic crisis is not as serious as people generally suppose.
上面三句都正确，从句的if, 主谓都可以省。
- 独立主格, 在分词做状语的基础上多了一个名词而已
- 主句确定时态，名词确定主动还是被动
>Time ***permitting***, we will go to the Great Wall.
>All things ***considered***, the economic crisis is not as serious as people generally suppose.
>All flights ***having been canceled*** because of the snowstorm, many passengers had to take the train.
######2.3 不定式：to do 
- 不定式表将来
>If the building project _________ by the end of this month is delayed, the construction company will be fined.
A. being completed
B. is completed
***C. to be completed***
D. completed
####3. 倒装
- 句首出现***介词短语***要完全倒装
- 谓语动词的数量，时态，语态是由主语决定的
- 如出现逗号就不用倒装了
######3.1 完全倒装： 谓语＋主语
>The house stands on the beach.
On the beach stands the house.
His votes are within 50 millions.
Within 50 million are his votes.
######3.2 部分倒装：谓语1部分＋主语+谓语2部分
- 就是把谓语分成两部分，一部分提前，只有一个谓语的，就提前就好

|倒装前|倒装后|
|---|---|
|主语 have worked|have 主语 worked|
|主语 is working|is 主语 working|
|主语 works|do/does 主语 works|
|主语 worked|did 主语 work|
- Only＋状语(介词短语，副词，状语从句)
>You can come up with the solution to the problem only in this way.
Only in this way ***can you come up with the solution*** to the problem.
- So(表示“如此，这般”)
>The film was so instructive that the students wanted to see it again.
***So instructive was*** the film that the students wanted to see it again.
- 否定意义词 (状语)
>I seldom met such a brave man.
***Seldom did I meet*** such a brave man.
He did little to help in the crisis.
***Little did he do*** to help in the crisis.
They have the right to limit how much vitamin you want to take for no reason.
***For no reason do they*** have the right to limit how much vitamin you want to take.
